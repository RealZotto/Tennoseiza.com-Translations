# Chapter 0 : Temporality and powers

*This is the narrator speaking to you, and I will only speak in italics throughout the novel*  
And this is a character who thinks, sometimes indicated, but mostly Ao  
▓▓▓: "And this is me, ▓▓▓, engaging in a dialogue.. all by myself.."  
▓▓▓▓: "Come on ▓▓▓, I'm here you know?"  
▓▓▓: "That's right.. What would I do without you, T▓▓▓"

*In 2035,  
A creature named ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ awoke, deep in the B▓▓▓▓ space.  
This creature created many things, including what are known as 'Celestials', huge asteroids in appearance, but containing a consciousness of their own, a crust made of a super-powerful and naturally energetic metal known as 'Celestial Flesh'  
And even stranger things*

*These 'Celestials' have changed the very rules of our Universe, by beginning to manipulate and link themselves to the stars of our cosmos, and choosing to give the power of the stars to the human beings of planet Earth, giving them supernatural abilities based on the type of star linked to them  
This led to the collapse of our civilisation, as humans completely lost control of their new powers  
The 'Star Disaster'*

*Chaos and war reigned for more than 2,000 years, the Age of Chaos  
Before a legendary group of warriors put an end to it, and created the Pendragon Alliance  
And the Age of Kingdoms began*

*Great edifices were erected in honour of these legendary heroes, who gradually disappeared, taking refuge in their own private dimensions  
But the alliance endured, and continued the pacification by creating kingdoms everywhere, using.. let's say unorthodox means*

*Today, 3,000 years after the Star Disaster, the Pendragons are fighting to halt the advance of a highly contagious energy that is turning humans into 'demons'  
According to them, the world is on the verge of falling into darkness..*

*This is where Ao's story begins.*
